# Data simulation

## Simulated distributions


### Incubation period

```{r }

library(distcrete)
library(epitrix)

incub_mu <- 9.4
incub_sd <- 7.4

params <- gamma_mucv2shapescale(incub_mu,
                                incub_sd / incub_mu)

incubation <- distcrete("gamma",
                        interval = 1,
                        shape = params$shape,
                        scale = params$scale)

```




### Duration of exposures

Duration is drawn from a distribution $~ 1 + Exp(d - 1)$ where $d$ is the mean
duration of exposure (must be at least 1).

```{r }

duration_r <- function(n, mean = 1) {
  if (mean < 1) {
    msg <- "mean duration of exposure must be >=1 day"
    stop(msg)
  }
  
  1 + rpois(n, mean - 1)
}

```



### Dates of exposures

Date of exposure are drawn from a Uniform distribution on a given time-frame:

```{r }

date_exposure_r <- function(n, min = 0L, max = 30L) {
  base <- seq(from = min, to = max, by = 1L)
  N <- length(base)
  base[sample.int(N, size = n, replace = TRUE)]
}

```
